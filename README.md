# PassGen 🔐

## PassGen is a password generator tool full coded in Python ! 
I did this cybersecurity project to start practice Python because its said that its the most used programing language in the cybersecurity industry and its the most flexible and simple language to learn !

## Improvements in the future
Later I will try to fuse this tool with a password manager that I will create later ! 

## Usage
This tool was only tested in Windows 10 ! 
To use it you can download the zip file and run in a terminal or clone the project !
