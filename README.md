# PassGen 🔐

## PassGen is a password generator tool full coded in Python ! 
I did this cybersecurity project to start practicing Python because it is said that it is the most used programing language in the cybersecurity industry and it is the most flexible and simple language to learn !

## Improvements in the future
Later I will try to fuse this tool with a password manager that I will create later ! 

## Usage
This tool was tested on Windows 10 and on Kali Linux 2024.2 ! 

To use it you can download the zip file and run it in a terminal or clone the project ! 

``` 
git clone https://github.com/AlexRodrigues9581/PassGen.git
```
